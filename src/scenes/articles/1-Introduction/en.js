          The Pan-Amazonia region protects the world's largest rainforest, accounting for 40% of South America. It contains indigenous peoples covering 28% of the territory and mega biodiversity in protected areas that represent 23% of the region. Now, more than ever, this great cultural and natural wealth faces many challenges.

      <Paragraph>
        RAISG shows that, considering just mining and oil, 87.2 million hectares or 22% of the 390 million hectares dedicated to conservation and indigenous territories are subject to some kind of threat or pressure.
      </Paragraph>

      <Paragraph>
        The maps also show the presence of hydroelectric projects and roads in protected natural areas and in indigenous territories. In this case, 78 of the 272 large hydroelectric power plants in the Amazonia - planned, under construction or in operation - are inside indigenous territories and 84 are in conflict with protected natural areas. As far as roads, waterways and railways are concerned, of the 136,000 kilometres mapped in the region, approximately 20% (26,000 km) are superimposed onto protected natural areas and indigenous territories.
      </Paragraph>

      <Quote author="Richard C. Smith, director of the Instituto Bien ComÃºn, Peru">
        Currently, there is no national policies for the Amazonia that will allow us to draw up a comprehensive, coherent and long-term vision for the region. Thus, a clear territorial development strategy is also not in force. In fact, guidance for policy decisions depends mainly on circumstances and the will of the current rulers
